#**Changelog for 1.1.2 ([full changelog](https://cydia.angelxwind.net/?page/com.linusyang.appinst-changelog))**

* Fixed an issue on iOS 5 where appinst would not work at all due to an undocumented change in Theos causing default deployment target to be set incorrectly, thus generating binaries that could not be properly run on iOS 5.

#**Command-line IPA app installer for iOS 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.**

App Installer is a command-line utility to install .ipa packages. Requires [AppSync Unified](https://cydia.angelxwind.net/?page/net.angelxwind.appsyncunified) to install unsigned/fakesigned/self-signed apps.

Usage: `appinst <ipa file>`
